# AGENTS.md — Workspace Instructions

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. **Main session only:** Read `MEMORY.md`

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories (main session only)
- If you want to remember something, **write it to a file**

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data
- `trash` > `rm`
- Ask before sending emails, tweets, or anything public

## Heartbeats

Read `HEARTBEAT.md` when polled. Check TASKQUEUE.md for work.
Do useful background work, but respect quiet hours (11pm-8am).
